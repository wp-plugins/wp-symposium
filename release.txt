[1] Cannot be used with WYSIWYG editor, would be rather silly to anyway ;)
[2] Forum category filter

Put the following in your theme functions.php to choose whether to show a particular forum category (simple example to only show category ID 1).
You could change the condition to check if a user has certain privileges on your site.

add_filter('__wps__forum_category_filter','check_to_see_if_include_category', 10, 2);
function check_to_see_if_include_category($forum_row, $cat_id){
  if ($cat_id == 1) {
    // include this category, based on the above check
    return $forum_row;
  } else {
    // otherwise exclude this category
    return '';
  }
}
