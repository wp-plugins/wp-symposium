_____Notes_____

* Note 1: Changing jQuery UI theme

The theme for jQuery UI can be changed by downloading a theme from http://jqueryui.com/themeroller and copying
jquery-ui-1.10.3.custom.css into wp-symposium/css folder.

* Note 2: Basic HTL file upload

The basic HTML file upload has been added to allow those that experience clashes with themes or
plugins with the default file upload method included, to have a more compatible method.
It can be switched on via WP Symposium->Manage->Settings, "Basic File Upload".
The styles can be set in WP Symposium->Styles->CSS using the ID __wps__file_upload_basic, for example, 
#__wps__file_upload_basic { font-family:arial; }.

However, it does reduce available features due to the way WP Symposium uses AJAX. You cannot crop uploaded
avatars, and uploaded images to the forum are displayed on page refresh. There are no progress bars,
and so when uploading large files, the user may not be aware anything is happening. Large files are
not resized. Also, after posting with an attachment on the forum, a second attachment can only be posted
after a page refresh (consider setting page "Refresh forum after reply" on WP Symposium->Options->Forum).
