**MEMBER PROFILE PAGE**

*Overview*

The Member profile does not yet include all the functionality to form a useful page, but sets the foundation of sending mail to another another member, and linking the forum plugin and mail plugins. 

Put `[symposium-profile]` on any WP page, and put the page URL in the Symposium options.

* ... many more features to be added to this plugin!

*Settings*

* Allow members to over-ride default settings
* Set inactivity period for offline and logged out

**NOTIFICATION BAR**

*Overview*

The notification bar, if activated, can be placed at the bottom or top of every webpage. It shows a custom message to the left, a login/logout link to the right together with icons for specific purposes, ie: friends online, unread mail messages and friend requests.

When a member is logged in and a new mail arrives or a friend request is received, an alert is shown to the right instead of the logout link for a short period of time. Optionally, an alert sound (from a list available, defaulting to a subtle chime) is played.

The icons will also be highlighted with a number of unread messages or friend requests.

Clicking the friends online icon, will display which friends are online, not active and logged out. Clicking on a name will open a chat window (and on the recipients screen) for real time chatting.

Simply activate the plugin to use the notification bar.

*Settings*

* Place at top or bottom of page
* Change message to left of the bar
* Shows login/logout link to the right of the bar
* Use WP login/logout or custom URLs
* When logged in alerts show to the right of new mail
* Plays a sound when alerts show (optional)
* Shows friends online
* Set polling intervals for notifications and chat messages

**MAIL**

Private messaging for all your members! At present they can easily send a mail to another member of the site just by typing their display name. 

This will shortly be improved so that multiple recipients can be added. Furthermore mail can be limited to friends if the friends plugin is activated (yes - another plugin, but it's not available yet).

Put `[symposium-mail]` on any WP page, and put the page URL in the Symposium options.

* In Box

* AJAX enabled when switching between messages

Important - after activating for the first time, make sure you go to the Options page and set things up.

Tested with PHP 5.

*Automatic installation*

* go to Plugins->Add New and search for "Symposium"
* click on Install below WP-Symposium
* activate the plugins you want to use (core plugin MUST remain activated, and be activated first)
* important - go to the Options page to configure settings

*Manual installation*

* download from http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-symposium/
* unzip the contents of the ZIP file in your /wp-content/plugins folder
* activate the plugins you want via Plugins on the WordPress admin dashboard (including the core plugin)
* important - go to the Options page to configure

When upgrading manually, make sure you deactivate and re-activate the core plugin.

*Adding WP Symposium plugins to your site*

If you need to, create a new page in WordPress (Pages->Add New). Then put the following in a WordPress page (it's a hyphen, not an underscore):

For the Forum:

  `[symposium-forum]`
  
For the Member Profile:
  
  `[symposium-profile]`
  
For the Mail/Private Messaging:
  
  `[symposium-mail]`
  
Installation of the notification bar is just a matter of activating it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q. Where can I find more information?
A. Go to www.wpsymposium.com

Q. The admin side works, but the forum (or another plugin) doesn't appear?
A. Check you have `[symposium-forum]` on your page, with a hyphen, not an underscore. Replace [symposium-forum] with the shortcode of the plugin.

Q. I've done that, but the forum (or another plugin) still doesn't appear?
A. Have you put `[symposium-forum]` on a WordPress page, not an HTML file? 

Q. My language isn't supported, can I add my language?
A. Go to http://www.wpsymposium.com/forum/add-new-forum-language and we will add the language with your help, thank you.

Q. Are there images other than smilies?
A. Yes, if you look in the smilies folder you can use any of the images there by putting {{xxx}} around the first part of the filename, eg: {{rofl}} would show rofl.png - to see the full list, go to the Forum Smilies page at http://www.wpsymposium.com/forum/forum-smilies

Q. Will WP Symposium work on WPMU?
A. Sorry no, not at the moment - but it's planned to get this working at some point
