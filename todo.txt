The following development plan (to-do list) is ordered in MoSCoW priority.

==Must do (essential fixes/patches before next release)==

These items are stopping the product functioning for everyone. Individual installations may have problems, 
but these items are effecting everyone and so are core issues or new features.

==Should do (if bug fixing allows - planned to do for next release, but might not happen)==

This is the realistic list of what is coming soon.

* Add paramter for [symposium-forum GROUP=x CATEGORY=x]
* Alternative FB-like layout for profile page.
* Friends activity still including posts between members, should just be status posts and posts to that member
* Layout for forum replies should be same as initial post (ie. no text wrap)
* Templates: initial forum post and forum replies
* When posting a reply, the quick addition is showing full size avatar (probably on new topic too?). Check on Mac.
* Videos: Setting URLs and checking permissions
* Profile: Menu colour on WPS not following Styles, should it?
* Theme: Small user search seems very slow, check it
* Profile: Add delete icon to jQuery posts (deletes latest post for that user)
* Friends: Add Show more...
* Templates: Activity/Group Activity posts/replies
* Members: Base search on wp_users not usermeta
			
==Could do (if development time allows)==

If there were more hours in the day, then these items would move up to "Should do" items.

* Forum: Voting system
* Shoutbox: Widget for chatroom
* Photo Albums: Starting with photos, but scoped to eventually allow a Video (YouTube) library
* Hooks/Filters: For extensions and add-on plugins, including profile menu

==Would do (if life allows!)==

These are items that realistically won't get developed in the short term, but they are identified
as features that would improve the product and so will happen at some point.

* Poke: Implement (needs notifications)
* Profile: Optionally receive email on activity in wall post if I've replied or started it
* Mail: Quote feature
* Forum: Steven Tryon: linking blog to forum and vice versa
* Forum: Minimum level for categories
* Forum: U can vote for removal, and when x number of votes received, it is deleted
* Widget: 'clear my vote' link on vote widget
* Documentation: Provide technical documentation for developers to extend WP Symposium
