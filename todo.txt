The following development plan (to-do list) is ordered in MoSCoW priority. Because development is reactive to member requests on the forum, this list is not set in stone.

==Must do (essential fixes/patches before next release)==

These items are stopping the product functioning for everyone. Individual installations may have problems, 
but these items are effecting everyone and so are core issues or new features.

* None.

==Should do (if bug fixing allows)==

Planned to do for next release, but might not happen due to reactive nature of development to user requests.

* Show less mail in in/sent boxes, with Show More to reduce page length

==Could do (if development time allows)==

If there were more hours in the day, then these items would move up to "Should do" items.

* Interpret BBcode on forums in javascript
* Option to hide city and/or country from members profile.
* Option to exclude admin from members list.
* Add parameter for [symposium-forum GROUP=x CATEGORY=x]
* Layout for forum replies should be same as initial post (ie. no text wrap)
* Members: Base search on wp_users not usermeta
* Theme: Small user search seems very slow, check it
* Forum: Voting system + and -

==Would do (if life allows!)==

These are items that realistically won't get developed in the short term, but they are identified
as features that would improve the product and so will happen at some point.

* Wiki Videos: Setting URLs and checking permissions
* Poke: Implement (needs notifications)
* Profile: Optionally receive email on activity in wall post if I've replied or started it
* Mail: Quote feature
* Forum: Steven Tryon: linking blog to forum and vice versa
* Forum: Minimum level for categories
* Forum: You can vote for removal, and when x number of votes received, it is deleted
* Widget: 'clear my vote' link on vote widget
