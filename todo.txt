The following development plan (to-do list) is ordered in MoSCoW priority.

==Must do (essential fixes/patches before next release)==
These items are stopping the product functioning for everyone. Individual installations may have problems, 
but these items are effecting everyone and so are core issues or new features.

==Should do (if bug fixing allows - planned to do for next release, but might not happen)==
This is the realistic list of what is coming soon.

* Profile: Menu colour on WPS not following Styles, should it?
* Theme: Small user search seems very slow, check it
* Profile: Add delete icon to jQuery posts (deletes latest post for that user)
* Friends: Add Show more...
* Pop-up DIVs: Change to jQuery Dialog (activity, search, etc)
* Templates: Activity/Group Activity posts/replies
* Members: Base search on wp_users not usermeta
			
==Could do (if development time allows)==
If there were more hours in the day, then these items would move up to "Should do" items.

* Shoutbox: Widget for chatroom
* Photo Albums: Starting with photos, but scoped to eventually allow a Video (YouTube) library
* Hooks/Filters: For extensions and add-on plugins

==Would do (if life allows!)==
These are items that realistically won't get developed in the short term, but they are identified
as features that would improve the product and so will happen at some point.

* Poke: Implement (needs notifications)
* Profile: Optionally receive email on activity in wall post if I've replied or started it
* Mail: Quote feature
* Forum: Steven Tryon: linking blog to forum and vice versa
* Forum: Minimum level for categories
* Forum: U can vote for removal, and when x number of votes received, it is deleted
* Widget: 'clear my vote' link on vote widget
* Documentation: Provide technical documentation for developers to extend WP Symposium
