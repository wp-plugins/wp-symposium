The following development plan (to-do list) is ordered in MoSCoW priority. Because development is reactive to member requests on the forum, this list is not set in stone.

==Must do (essential fixes/patches before next release)==

These items are stopping the product functioning for everyone. Individual installations may have problems, 
but these items are effecting everyone and so are core issues or new features.

* None.

==Should do (if bug fixing allows)==

Planned to do for next release, but might not happen due to reactive nature of development to user requests.

* None.

==Could do (if development time allows)==

If there were more hours in the day, then these items would move up to "Should do" items.

* Bulk WPS mail to all members
* Interpret BBcode on forums in javascript
* Add parameter for [symposium-forum GROUP=x CATEGORY=x]
* Layout for forum replies should be same as initial post (ie. no text wrap)
* Theme: Small user search seems very slow, check it

==Would do (if life allows!)==

These are items that realistically won't get developed in the short term, but they are identified
as features that would improve the product and so will happen at some point.

* Wiki Videos: Setting URLs and checking permissions
* Mail: Quote feature
* Forum: Steven Tryon: linking blog to forum and vice versa
* Forum: Minimum level for categories
* Look at replacing login to store previous last_activity value
