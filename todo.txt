GROUPS

	The groups plugin has a issue with wp default permalink setting. It does not call pages correctly and
	will not let you create or view groups. I had to change my site to numeric permalinks for plugin to work.

Should do (planned to do for next release, but might not happen)
---------

- Forum - reputation
- Forum - marked certain users as support (different colour)

Could do (if development time allows)
--------

- Forum - users can vote for removal, and when x number of votes received, it is deleted

Would do (if life allows!)

- Implement poke (needs notifications)
- optionally receive email on activity in wall post if I've replied or started it
- Codex
- Mail: quote feature
- Forum: Steven Tryon: linking blog to forum and vice versa
- Minimum level for categories
